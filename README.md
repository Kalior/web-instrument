# Web instrument

The purpose of this project is to create a web interfance for creating an instrument.

## Features:

- [x] Setting overtones
- [x] Setting a melody
- [ ] Some sort of resonance (maybe)
- [x] Setting envelope

## Developing

In order to build the sass files into css run `npm run build` (or `npm start` if you want it to automatically build on change) and in order to build the JSX react files into bundle.js run `npm run jsbuild` (or `npm run dev`).

Moreover, the css from `rc-slider-colored` needs to be moved into the css folder as I can't figure out how to import it properly.
